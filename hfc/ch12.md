## HFC12: Threads

* perform several diff tasks at once
* example of a computer game diff tasks
1) update graphics
2) read control info
3) communicae with disk and network
4) calculate location of object moving in game

*ch11 on dealing with several clients on a network server/doing several things at once using processes is not enough. 
## why not?
* processes take time to create
* processes cant share data easily
* processes are diff

## threads will start separate task quickly, share all your current data, wot need huge amount of code to build
* multithreaded (shop with several ppl)
* pg 508 does not ex
* pg 519 beers example with mutex
