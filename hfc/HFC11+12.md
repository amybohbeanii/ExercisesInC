## HFC11: Sockets and Networking

* C is used to write most low level networking code
* most networked applications need a server and client
* telnet example to talk to server
* data stream socket to talk to network

```
#include <sys/socket.h>

//descriptor for the socket
int listener_d = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if(listener_d==-1){
  error("cant open socket");
}
```
* server can talk to client program, but it has to BLAB 
1) Bind to a port
  * Computer runs several servers. It might send out web pages, posting emails, running chat server. To prevent diff convos from getting confused, each server uses a diff port (Think of channel on a TV). 
  * To bind, you need socket descriptor and socket name. socket name is struct that means "internet port 30000"
  
```
#include <arpa/inet.h> //for creating internet addresses

/*lines to create name for port 30000*/
struct sockaddr_in name;
name.sin_family = PF_INET;
name.sin_port = (in_port_t)htons(30000);
name.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
int c = bind(listener_d,(struct sockaddr *) &name,sizeof(name));
if (c==-1){
  error("cant bind to socket");
}  
```
2) Listen
3) Accept a connection
4) Begin talking
