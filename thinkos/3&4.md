**Chapter 3: Virtual Memory**

1. *The Georgian alphabet has 33 letters. How many bits are needed to specify a letter?*
  * 6 bits = 64 values. 

2. *In the UTP-16 character encoding, the binary representation of a character can take up to 32 bits. Ignoring the details of the encoding scheme, how many different characters can be represented?*
  * A 32-bit character can have 4,294,967,296 possible characters. A character set that large should be able to store every possible character in the world.

3. *What is the difference between "memory" and "storage" as defined in ThinkOS?*
  * The main difference is that memory is binary and storage is decimal.
