## Chapter 8

### Multitasking

### What is the kernel's most basic task?

### When an interrupt occurs, what part of the hardware state is saved by hardware?

### What is the difference between an interrupt and a context switch?

### Give an example of an event that might cause a process to move from the blocked to the ready state.

### Why might a scheduler want to give higher priority to an I/O bound process?

### When I make French toast, I usually make a batch of 12 slices. But my griddle only has room for 8 slices. Each piece of toast has to cook for 5 minutes on each side. How can I schedule 12 slices onto 8 "cores" to minimize the elapsed time to cook all 12 slices? (Note: this question is not hypothetical; this is really how I make French toast.)

## Chapter 9

### POSIX threads and mutexes

### As you read Chapter 9, you should compile and run the example code. By the nature of multi-threaded programs, you results will probably be different from mine, possibly in interesting ways.

### Why does each thread have its own stack?

### What does the gcc flag -lpthread do?

### What does the argument of pthread_exit do?

### Normally the same thread that created a thread also waits to join it. What happens if another thread tries to join a thread it did not create?

### What goes wrong if several threads try to increment a shared integer at the same time?

### What does it mean to "lock a mutex"?
