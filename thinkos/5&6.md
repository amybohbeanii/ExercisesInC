### Chapter 5: Bits and bytes


1. _**Suppose you have the value 128 stored as an unsigned 8-bit number. What happens if you convert it to a 16-bit number and accidentally apply sign extension?**_
  *  

2. _**Write a C expression that computes the two's complement of 12 using the XOR bitwise operator. Try it out and confirm that the result is interpreted as -12**_
  * 
  
3. _**Can you guess why IEEE floating-point uses biased integers to represent the exponent rather than a sign bit or two's complement?**_
  * 

4. _**Following the example in Section 5.4, write the 32-bit binary representatioin of -13 in single precision IEEE floating-point. What would you get if you accidentally interpreted this value as an integer?**_
  * 
  
5. _**Write a function that takes a string and converts from lower-case to upper-case by flipping the sixth bit. As a challenge, you can make a faster version by reading the string 32 or 64 bits at a time, rather than one character at a time. This optimization is made easier if the length of the string is a multiple of 4 or 8 bytes.**_

### Chapter 6: Memory Management


1. _**Which memory management functions would you expect to take constant time? Which ones take time proportional to the size of the allocated chunk?**_
  * 
  
2. _**For each of the following memory errors, gie an example of something that might go wrong:**_
  * Reading from unallocated memory.
  * Writing to unallocated memory.
  * Reading from a freed chunk.
  * Writing to a freed chunk.
  * Failing to free a chunk that is no longer needed.
  
3. _**run "ps aux --sort rss" to see a list of processes sorted by RSS, which is "resident set size", the amount of physical memory a process has. Which processes are using the  most memory?**_
  * 
  
4. _**What's wrong with allocating a large number of small chunks? What can you do to mitigate the problem?**_
  *
