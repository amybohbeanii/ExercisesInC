Written Sprint Reflection

During 2/02, which was also Sprint2 meeting1, our team discussed our kaizen, which will help our team be more efficient and productive in sprint2. Dedicating a bit of our discussion time to talk about our kaizen was a great intervention to make sure our team members are all on the same page. For example, we have decided 1) to read according to the schedule. We got a bit ahead on the readings, which did not help in understanding the details in previous readings 2) to divide up work in a productive manner: to put two people, instead of one person, on the same important task 3) to be more active in conversing about the project. Besides talking about our kaizen, as the sprint master, I thought it would be great to list some of the positive points of what went well in our Sprint1, in order to keep the team motivated. I did this by intervening and saying that our positive points were 1) that we kept iterating on our mockups for the final product and 2) we kept up with the readings.
We followed the eduScrum schedule according to what the professors said we should be working on for that day and adapting our project needs to the current schedule. 
We were prepared for Sprint1 review and received full credit. For the two criteria, project and readings, we were well prepared to discuss the project portion because we already had a draft of the proposal ready to be conversed about. We discovered we were unprepared for the reading questions because we got too ahead in the readings. 
Our activity throughout the sprint changed because we expected everyone to be on track, but some tasks took us longer than expected. For example, researching about cycloids, OpenGL, and physics engines took us a long time to understand because majority of our team members have never worked with this topic or software.

Think OS reading question answers

I worked on chapters 1 and 2 during sprint1. 
Chapter 1:
1. A feature common in interpreted languages but is rare in compiled languages are dynamic types.
2. Two advantages of static typing over dynamic typing is 1) error checking and 2) quickness of error checking
3. An example of a static semantic error is spelling a variable name wrong
4. Two reasons to turn off code optimization is 1) optimization may produce bugs 2) hard to trace code for debugging if you’re not familiar with the language
5. The results look different on different computers because of different architecture
6. The errors might look different because the errors are produced in different parts of the process
7. A segmentation fault is when you cannot read and write to an address.
Chapter 2: 
1. A real world example of virtualization is the company Amazon. 
2. The difference between a program and a process is that the process runs the program.
3. The primary purpose of process abstraction is it allows users to use complicated systems and it gives the illusion of simplicity.
4. The kernel is a part of the Operating System that has core capabilities.
5. A Daemon is a helper.



Exam question(s) and solution

What are two ways users can put in effort to optimize code? (draws from ThinkOS ch1 question 4)
1. user can rearrange code
2. user can write better algorithms
What should you use to debug a segmentation fault? (draws from ThinkOS ch1 question 7)
1. gdb
