### Written Sprint Reflection

My personal learning goals for Sprint2 was to keep up with the readings, submissions, and improve my productivity in helping with the group project based on the kaizen realized during Sprint2 Meeting 1. During Sprint2, I was unable to make it to the sprint review, but I made sure my team had the notes for the reading. I was able to complete the rough draft for Project 1 Preliminary Report which was ready to be conversed about. I think as the project gets further, the more I realize that the project is quite difficult. Since we are creating a custom physics engine, it gives our team practice with programming, physics, and math. To combine that with learning C++ and C is a challenge. Also, we have been testing using different software such as OpenGL, Bullet Physics Engine, Blender, so it has been a great learning experience, but also a huge challenge. My personal learning goal by the end of Sprint3 is to submit a project we are satisfied with and be more familiar with vector math, which is an essential component to our final submission.
